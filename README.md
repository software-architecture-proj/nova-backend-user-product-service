# üë§ User Service ‚Äî PostgreSQL Database

This document describes the data schema of the **User Service**, which manages identity, verification, and budgeting data within the banking platform.

This service **integrates directly with the Transactions Service**, where both `users` and `pockets` are interpreted as **financial accounts**. This abstraction allows for seamless money transfers between users and between their pockets.

---

## üßæ Schema Overview

The PostgreSQL database consists of the following tables:

- [`user`](#user)
- [`country_code`](#country_code)
- [`favorites`](#favorites)
- [`verification`](#verification)
- [`pocket`](#pocket)

---

## üîÅ Relationship with Transactions Service

In the **Transactions** service, both **users and pockets are modeled as TigerBeetle accounts**.

- ‚úÖ A `user` can **receive or send money** from/to:
  - Other users
  - Their own pockets

- ‚úÖ A `pocket` can **only interact** with its **owning user**.
  - It is used for internal money organization (e.g. budgets, goals).
  - It cannot receive funds from other users.

This design allows TigerBeetle to treat both as `Account` structures, each with unique identifiers, encoded fields, and behavioral flags.
